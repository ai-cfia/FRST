# Functional Realignment Scenario Tool (FRST)

## What is FRST?
FRST is a scenario building tool to support resource allocation decision-making 
within the context of risk and resource alignment flexibility

## How Does FRST Work?
The current risk model uses the Treasury Board Secretariat's Project Complexity
and Risk Assessment + an inflation co-efficient to determine variability of net
benefit
